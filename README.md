## Caesar Cipher Encoder

### Introduction
The Caesar Cipher Encoder is a simple web-based encryption tool that helps users encode their messages using the Caesar cipher, one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques. This project provides an intuitive user interface for encrypting text by shifting letters based on a given key.

### Features
- User-friendly UI with step-by-step encryption process
- Input plain text and choose a shift value
- Instant encryption of the message
- Clean and aesthetic design
- Fully responsive for different screen sizes

### Tech Stack
HTML – Structure of the webpage
CSS – Styling and layout
JavaScript – Encryption logic and interactivity

### Thought Process & Implementation

#### Concept & Inspiration
I wanted to create a simple yet interactive encryption tool that allows users to explore the Caesar Cipher in an easy-to-understand manner. The goal was to design a visually appealing website while keeping the encryption process clear and intuitive.

#### Functionality & Encryption Logic
The core functionality is written in JavaScript:
1. The user enters a plain text message.
2. A shift value is provided (which determines how many positions each letter moves).
3. The script iterates over each character, shifting only alphabetic letters while keeping spaces, numbers, and symbols unchanged.
4. The encrypted message is displayed dynamically.


#### Usage
1. Enter your plain text message
2. Choose a shift value
3. Click the Encrypt button
4. View your encrypted message
